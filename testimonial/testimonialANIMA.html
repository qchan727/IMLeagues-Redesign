                    Simply put IMLeagues is by far the easiest, most interactive, and graphically appealing online
                    intramural league registration program out there on the market, today. Their friendly staff and
                    customer service is top notch. I&#39;ve tried two previous online registration programs before but
                    none compare to IMLeagues! The third time was definitely a charm!

                    They continue to improve their product while striving to make this number one in our field. They
                    have made our jobs easier and for that alone we would recommend this as the best in its field.

                    evolving and getting better and better! The staff is always available and helpful which helps make
                    my job a lot easier. The IMLeagues staff encourages feedback and makes prompt adjustments
                    accordingly. The bottom line is that there is not another system out there that can come close to
                    the IMLeagues experience, regardless of price.

                    and they have all been incredibly helpful. As a larger program, we were looking for a way to
                    schedule our leagues that was both user-friendly for us and our participants, as well as a
                    comprehensive officials scheduling option; IMLeagues has exceeded my expectations for this. They
                    have added new features, adjusted current features, so it is more applicable to our program, and are
                    always willing to walk and talk us through various facets of their site. After researching several
                    different league and staff scheduling programs, I am very happy with our selection to go with

                    IMLeagues has made my life so much easier. I’ve used IPS, EZ Leagues, and IM Track and this is by
                    far the most user friendly with the best tech support. Free Agents are no longer a hassle; IMLeagues
                    takes care of that. The idea of combining Facebook with an Intramural software was genius.
                    Communication with the captains is unbelievable. No more calling every captain; just send out an
                    update and they get a message, email, and a text message. It doesn&#39;t get much better than that.

                    imleagues.com has been a fantastic addition to our Intramural Sports Dept! They have allowed us to
                    have online registration, and posted schedules and brackets which we haven’t had in the past. The
                    system is very easy to use and it continues to get better and faster each week. The IMLeagues team
                    has been great and has been working hard to meet our needs which may be seen as unique to most
                    Intramural departments. If we have an issue, they have live support chat or can be contacted by
                    phone most all times during the day. They respond quickly, take action, and implement the necessary
                    changes.I have had the honor of being asked for their opinions on the site of potential changes or
                    what changes should be made. They actively seek the opinions of their users and make changes that
                    only make the site better, more efficient, and faster. Having used other systems in the past, I
                    would strongly recommend using this site because of the customer service, features that are offered,
                    and best yet it’s FREE and the advertising is very tasteful and unobtrusive.

                    assist us in our goal of operating our program more efficiently and effectively. After testing 3
                    options last summer we made the decision in late August to go with IMLeagues to run our entire
                    program for the Fall &#39;08 semester. The site has evolved a great deal over the past 6 months and
                    I am happy to say Doug and the IMLeagues’ staff have helped BGSU achieve our original goal. I would

                    I went to the NIRSA Conference in Austin, TX in &#39;08 searching for new ideas to help catapult my
                    already growing Intramural Department. When I went to the NIRSA Expo I stopped by the IMLeagues
                    booth and was blown away at the websites capabilities. I thought to myself that there is no way I
                    will be able to bring this to DMACC. It has to cost a fortune! When I found out it was free I was
                    completely on board. Before IMLeagues we were like a lot of schools, stuck with paper forms and a
                    lot of extra work. With the budget cuts these days and the push to go green, I don’t know why anyone
                    wouldn’t use this website. It has allowed our numbers to increase because people can sign up when it
                    is convenient for them, whether that be from their home or at school. My staff refers to it as the
                    “Facebook” for Intramurals. It has been a great for our participants to be able to meet new people
                    and have become more involved. IMLeagues has helped us with some of the issues of being a commuter
                    college. It allows us to stay in contact with our intramural participants and by doing so has
                    allowed our program to grow. Greg and his staff have been great to work with and their customer
                    service has surpassed any and all expectations.

                    Being new to the profession of Campus Recreation and Intramurals, I did not know about any software
                    programs like imleagues.com. I began to do everything by hand, which became very time consuming.
                    When I was introduced to the program, I was a little nervous because I was a little intimidated with
                    the technological aspect of the program. Once I learned how to do everything, I look back and
                    realize how easy and simple everything was. I know for a fact, I would not have been able to figure
                    it out as fast had, I not had the tech support that the site provides. There were times where I was
                    chatting/emailing them almost every day with new questions about how to do this and how to do that.
                    Not only did they take the time to explain it, they were courteous and friendly. They want to help.
                    The designers have seen the need for a program like this, and is trying to make improvements as it
                    goes a long. Although, I know they have helped me a lot, I know I have helped them as well building
                    a better product. They constantly ask for feedback on how to make the site better. I could not ask
                    for anything more. This product, and the company of IMLeagues is easy to use, and have the best
                    customer service standards hands down. They are not doing this website for themselves. They are
                    doing it for schools.

                    IMLeagues has made my job as an Intramural administrator so much easier. Instead of spending six
                    hours to create game schedules and playoff brackets then cross referencing the games to ensure the
                    facility were not double booked, I am currently only spending two hours to schedule things.
                    IMLeagues has given me the opportunity to focus more on student development (officials and
                    participants), instead of creating schedules and inputting results. Plus, Doug, Greg, and Ben are
                    great at answering questions and walking the students step by step through the site, who are
                    struggling. I would highly recommend IMLeagues to any Intramural program, regardless of the size of
                    the program.

                    I came to work in the Intramural Department at the University of West Georgia around 2004. At this
                    time, our team registration was a nightmare. Every team had to fill out a roster waiver form and get
                    it signed by all team members. The team manager had to come to our office and pay for the team.
                    During the registration period, it was just about impossible having to sign the teams up for certain
                    leagues and taking their money. I would have students standing all the way outside the office door
                    waiting to be signed up. Another issue was that our department was taking in several thousand
                    dollars and we had to secure the money in a safe and then deposit it at the cashier&#39;s office.
                    Our department decided to come up with a registration on-line. Our ITS department did a wonderful
                    job of setting this up, but there were a lot of problems as we started using this program. Also,
                    this program required us to go through Banner and Banner was often offline and not working properly.
                    Also, there was no way that the students could pay on-line. Also, since our ITS department was
                    under-staffed, when a serious problem came along, there was no one to assist us in some major
                    problems.One of our personnel in Campus Recreation heard about the IMLeagues. After research, our
                    Campus Recreation Director and Sports Director decided that our department would try IMLeagues. We
                    are presently using this and my workload has been reduced tremendously. The students are registering
                    and paying online. We love the new system and the students love the new system.The personnel at
                    IMLEAGUES (Ben and Doug) have been excellent in working with us to get the process going. They are
                    always there to help me out, and it is a joy working with them.Thanks to IMLeagues—my stress level
                    has decreased tremendously.

                    I have been programming for about four years now at UALR, and have been involved within the
                    intramural program for the last six. When I first started the job it was in serious need of some
                    updating. We used software that was out-dated and only worked on one computer, the score sheets we
                    printed from other websites, and roster checks and school enrollment was done by hand. imleagues.com
                    changed our game! They provided everything that we needed. They cut out the endless paper work, took
                    away over 75% of our call volume, and most of all, made our program available twenty-four hours a
                    day. I highly recommend this web site and their support staff for your Intrmaural needs.

                    The modern student lives in an online-customizable world. Don&#39;t punish them with more paperwork
                    and boring bulletin boards. IMLeagues has given our students control of their intramural sports:
                    Increased communication, schedule access, and interaction. From an administrator’s perspective, I
                    can create more accountability for every participant.

                    The customer service and response time from the staff is far and away the best I have experienced
                    from a software system.

                    At first I was against going completely online for Intramurals, because I didnt think that students
                    would enjoy it and I thought it would be complicated and time consuming. I was completely wrong.
                    imleagues.com has completely enhanced our Intramural Department. The ability to send out mass emails
                    to leagues, divisions, all participants, etc... at the click of a button is outstanding. I also
                    enjoy having the schedules live as soon as I create them. I am thoroughly impressed with
                    imleagues.com

                    I have been with IMLeagues for 3 years and used the system on two campuses successfully. Our
                    students love the system by being able to access their intramural information by a simple click of
                    the mouse 24 hours a day. The IMLeagues staff has been incredibly helpful with any problems that
                    have occurred, and made incredible improvements that has just made my job so much easier. IMLeagues
                    has cut our paperwork out by over 75% and reduced the amount of tedious work with scheduling
                    leagues, divisions, and tournaments. The biggest factor is that the website has reduced my stress
                    levels by a huge amount, and it has given me more time to focus on staff development and future
                    programming ideas. IMLeagues is by far the best online system out there regardless of the size of
                    your department or institution. Thank you guys and keep up the great work!
